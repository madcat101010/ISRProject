See final report for usage. Or see existing .sh files for examples. It is recommended to log the .sh file activity using something such as: "./*.sh > log_file_name.txt"

Check list to run:

1) Read the final report to fully understand how and why the following tasks need to be done

2) Unzip any training data in ./data/training/ as these would be too large for github.

3) ./data/ folder must be pushed to the hadoop file system

4) ./jarlib/ folder has the required dependency .jar files. These are not part of the repo as they are massive files.

5) All other dependencies are installed. Dependencies for running and compiling are different.

6) Use "sbt package" to build... and to see if something else is missing.

Beware: Git hub has file size limits! Commit and push rejection will be annoying to handle. Let's say I had some annoying problems with reverting and losing comit work that was not pushed to the remote repo.
